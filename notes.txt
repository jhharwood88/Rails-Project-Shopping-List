Notes:

devise is acceptable for omniauth 

ToDo:

lookup how to access "undefined method `relation_delegate_class'"




Done:

remove quantity from item, item list has item id and quantity 

include validations for item model, validate presence on name for shopping list/item list

add shoppinglist id to itemlist

new join on item list, shopping list is no longer a join table
	a shopping list is always associated with a user, creating new list associates items with list through itemid.
