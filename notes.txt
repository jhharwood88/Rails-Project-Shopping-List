Notes:

devise is acceptable for omniauth 


ToDo:






new join on item list, shopping list is no longer a join table
	a shopping list is always associated with a user, creating new list associates items with list through itemid.


Done:

remove quantity from item, item list has item id and quantity 

include validations for item model, validate presence on name for shopping list/item list
