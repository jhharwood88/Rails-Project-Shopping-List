This is the readme for Shopping List

	This project was designed to allow a user to login or signup for a shopping list managment application. The user will go to their collection page of shopping lists, if none exist they can choose to create a new shopping list. After creating or choosing a shopping list, the user can add any of the items they choose, in any quantity to their list from a drop down selection of available items. A filter can be applied to only show certain categories of items on the list.

Getting Started

	To install this application you must first fork and clone the repo. The user will then run bundle install to load all gem dependencies for the application. The application can then be accessed at its root level from localhost:3000
